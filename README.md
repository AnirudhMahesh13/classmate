# 🎓 Classmate – Academic Support, Reimagined

Classmate is a centralized student success platform that helps post-secondary students navigate their courses, professors, and academic life with ease. Unlike fragmented tools like RateMyProfessors, Discord study servers, or Reddit threads, Classmate brings it all together in one clean, course-specific experience.

## 🚀 What is Classmate?

Students succeed not through generic advice, but by understanding *how each specific course is taught and graded by each professor*.

Classmate empowers students to:
- 🔍 Browse and follow courses at their school
- 🧑‍🏫 View professor-specific insights and reviews
- 🧠 Join peer-led study groups and communities
- 📚 Book verified tutors, manage sessions, and handle payments – all in one place
- ✍️ Submit course reviews and contribute to a growing academic support ecosystem

Currently built with **Next.js**, **Firebase**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Stripe**, and **AWS S3**, Classmate is designed to scale with both student demand and institutional needs.

## 💡 Why Classmate?

**Because school isn’t a system. It’s a network.**

Students are left guessing every semester – which prof to take, how they grade, how to prepare, and where to find help. Classmate eliminates that guesswork and builds a student-first academic experience rooted in transparency, community, and accessibility.
